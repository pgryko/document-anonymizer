# VAE Training Configuration - Local Testing/Debugging
# ====================================================
#
# Optimized for local Mac development and testing:
# - Minimal memory usage for MPS backend
# - Small batch sizes and reduced epochs
# - Conservative settings for debugging
# - Fast iteration for development

# Model configuration
model_name: "document-anonymizer-vae-local"
version: "v1.0-local"
base_model: "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1-base"

# Training parameters - Optimized for local testing
batch_size: 1                   # Minimal for MPS memory constraints
learning_rate: 5.0e-4           # Same as production for consistency
num_epochs: 2                   # Very few epochs for quick testing
gradient_accumulation_steps: 4  # Compensate for small batch size
mixed_precision: "no"           # Disable for compatibility
gradient_clipping: 1.0

# Loss configuration - Same as production
loss:
  kl_weight: 0.00025            # KL divergence weight
  perceptual_weight: 0.1        # Perceptual loss for text preservation
